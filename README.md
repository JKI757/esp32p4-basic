```

## Hardware Requirements

- Waveshare ESP32-P4 development board with ESP32-C6 coprocessor
- USB cable for power and programming
- Optional: 7" or 10.1" touchscreen display for GUI extension

## Software Dependencies

- **ESP-IDF**: v5.x framework
- **ESP-Hosted**: Communication framework between ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C6  
- **WiFi Remote**: Automatic API remapping for remote WiFi calls
- **LVGL**: (for future GUI development) v9.2.0

## Build Instructions

All commands must be run from the `p4-base/` directory:

```bash
# Set target to ESP32-P4 (required first step)
idf.py set-target esp32p4

# Configure project (optional - defaults should work)
idf.py menuconfig

# Build project
idf.py build

# Flash to device and monitor
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

To exit the serial monitor, type `Ctrl-]`.

## Usage

Once flashed and running, connect via USB Serial JTAG and use these commands:

**WiFi Commands:**
- `scan` or `s`: Scan for available WiFi networks
- `list` or `l`: List previously scanned networks  
- `connect <ssid> <password>`: Connect to WiFi network
- `status` or `st`: Show current WiFi connection status
- `disconnect` or `d`: Disconnect from current network

**BLE Commands:**
- `ble_start` or `bs`: Start BLE advertising (Nordic UART Service)
- `ble_stop` or `bp`: Stop BLE advertising
- `ble_status` or `bt`: Show detailed BLE status
- `ble_scan [duration]` or `bsc`: Scan for nearby BLE devices
- `ble_name <name>` or `bn`: Set BLE device name
- `ble_debug` or `bd`: Show comprehensive BLE debug information

**General:**
- `help` or `h`: Show command help

## Development Notes

### ESP-Hosted Integration
- Standard `esp_wifi_*` functions are automatically remapped to remote calls
- Communication handled transparently by ESP-Hosted framework
- SDIO transport provides reliable P4â†”C6 communication

### GUI Extension Ready
This project is designed for easy extension with a touchscreen GUI:
- Reference examples available in `../waveshare-source/ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT_Demo/`
- LVGL integration examples in `3_Advanced/LVGL/`
- BSP support for 7" and 10.1" displays

### Code Quality
- Modern C++ patterns throughout
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Event-driven architecture for responsiveness
- Clean separation of WiFi management and user interface

## Troubleshooting

- If WiFi scan fails, ensure ESP32-C6 is properly connected and ESP-Hosted is initialized
- For connection issues, verify network credentials and signal strength
- Use `idf.py monitor` to see detailed logging output
- Check SDIO communication if WiFi remote functions fail
